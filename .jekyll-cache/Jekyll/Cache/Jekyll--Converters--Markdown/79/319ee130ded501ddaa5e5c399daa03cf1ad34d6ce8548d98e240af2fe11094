<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúAllergy is a major cause of morbidity worldwide. The number of characterized allergens and related information is increasing rapidly creating demands for advanced information storage, retrieval and analysis. Bioinformatics provides useful tools for analysing allergens and these are complementary to traditional laboratory techniques for the study of allergens. Specific applications include structural analysis of allergens, identification of B- and T-cell epitopes, assessment of allergenicity and cross-reactivity, and genome analysis. In this paper, the most important bioinformatic tools and methods with relevance to the study of allergy have been reviewed.‚Äù</p>
