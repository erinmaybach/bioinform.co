## Summary ##

WGCNA is an R package for building weighted gene correlation networks for analysis (thus the name) from expression data. Simply put, gene co-expression networks identify genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. Weighted correlation networks extend to this idea to identify clusters, or modules, of highly correlated genes and integrates complimentary genomic datasets. With a basic understanding of the objectives of building weighted gene correlation networks you are set to work through the Bioinformatics Workbook tutorial, "Network Analysis with WGCNA". In addition to the internal links provided to other relevant tutorials along the way, we love this Bioinformatics Workbook tutorial for its meticulously guided steps, external resources provided, and conceptual graphics that help visualize core concepts.    
# TLDR;

If you're looking to learn how to use the WGCNA R package we reccomend skipping the tutorials provided by the package developper and opting for the "Network analysis wuth WGCNA" tutorial by Bioknformatics Workbook instead!
