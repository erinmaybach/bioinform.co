# Abstract
  > "One-quarter of photosynthesis-derived carbon on Earth rapidly cycles through a set of 
short-lived seawater metabolites that are generated from the activities of marine phytoplankton, 
bacteria, grazers and viruses. Here we discuss the sources of microbial metabolites in the 
surface ocean, their roles in ecology and biogeochemistry, and approaches that can be used to 
analyse them from chemistry, biology, modelling and data science. Although microbial-derived 
metabolites account for only a minor fraction of the total reservoir of marine dissolved organic 
carbon, their flux and fate underpins the central role of the ocean in sustaining life on Earth."
