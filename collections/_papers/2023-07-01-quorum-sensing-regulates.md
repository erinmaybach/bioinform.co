# Abstract
  > "Bacteria play a crucial role in marine biogeochemistry by releasing, consuming 
and transforming organic matter. Far from being isolated entities, bacteria are 
involved in numerous cellâ€“cell interactions. Among such interactions, quorum 
sensing (QS) allows bacteria to operate in unison, synchronizing their actions 
through chemical communication. This review aims to explore and synthesize our 
current knowledge of the involvement of QS in the regulation of bacterial processes 
that ultimately impact marine biogeochemical cycles. We first describe the 
principles of QS communication and the renewed interest in its study in marine 
environments. Second, we highlight that the microniches where QS is most likely to 
occur due to their high bacterial densities are also hotspots of bacterially 
mediated biogeochemical transformations. Many bacterial groups colonizing these 
microniches harbor various QS systems. Thereafter, we review relevant QS-regulated 
bacterial processes in marine environments, building on research performed in both 
complex marine assemblages and isolated marine bacteria. QS pathways have been 
shown to directly regulate organic matter degradation, carbon allocation and 
nutrient acquisition but also to structure the community composition by mediating 
colonization processes and microbial interactions. Finally, we discuss current 
limitations and future perspectives to better characterize the link between QS 
expression and the bacterial mediation of biogeochemical cycles. The picture drawn 
by this review highlights QS as one of the pivotal mechanisms impacting microbial 
composition and functions in the oceans, paving the way for future research to 
better constrain its impact on marine biogeochemical cycles."
