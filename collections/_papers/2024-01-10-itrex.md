# Abstract
 > Advancements in DNA sequencing techniques enabled researchers to sequence the human genome in just a day, a task that consumed around a decade with the traditional approaches. This is only one of many powerful contributions of machine learning in bioinformatics. This article gives a brief introduction to ML, explains how it supports biomedical research, and enumerates the challenges you might face deploying this technology.
