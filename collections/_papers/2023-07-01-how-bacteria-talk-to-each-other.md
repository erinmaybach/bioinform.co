 # Abstract
  > "Quorum sensing, or the control of gene expression in response 
to cell density, is used by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive 
bacteria to regulate a variety of physiological functions. In all 
cases, quorum sensing involves the production and detection of 
extracellular signalling molecules called autoinducers. While 
universal signalling themes exist, variations in the design of the 
extracellular signals, the signal detection apparatuses, and the 
biochemical mechanisms of signal relay have allowed quorum sensing 
systems to be exquisitely adapted for their varied uses. Recent 
studies show that quorum sensing modulates both intra- and 
inter-species cell–cell communication, and it plays a major role 
in enabling bacteria to architect complex community structures."
