# Abstract

> "The current outbreak of COVID-19 has generated an unprecedented scientific response worldwide, with the generation of vast amounts of publicly available epidemiological, biological and clinical data. Bioinformatics scientists have quickly produced online methods to provide non-computational users with the opportunity of analyzing such data. In this review, we report the results of this effort, by cataloguing the currently most popular web tools for COVID-19 research and analysis. Our focus was driven on tools drawing data from the fields of epidemiology, genomics, interactomics and pharmacology, in order to provide a meaningful depiction of the current state of the art of COVID-19 online resources."
